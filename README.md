# BioStream JS: DNA Sequence Analyzer

A fast, responsive, and purely client-side tool for basic bioinformatics operations. 


## 🧬 Overview
BioStream JS is designed for researchers, students, and hobbyists who need a quick way to manipulate DNA sequences without needing heavy software or server-side processing. It handles sequence cleaning, base composition analysis, and protein translation with an intuitive interface.

## ✨ Features
* **Sequence Sanitization:** Automatically removes whitespace and non-ATGC characters, providing a "clean" count for calculations.
* **Composition Analysis:** Instantly calculate **GC Content** and **AT Content** percentages.
* **Strand Manipulation:** Generate the **Complement** and **Reverse Complement** of any sequence.
* **Protein Translation:** Translate DNA into amino acids based on the standard genetic code.
    * Supports **Reading Frames 1, 2, and 3**.
    * Handles stop codons (marked as `*`).
* **Example Utility:** Load a sample sequence to see the tool in action immediately.
